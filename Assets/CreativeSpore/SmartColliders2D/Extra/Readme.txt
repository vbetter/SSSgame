The Extra folder contains several samples using the Smart Colliders to create a simple platform game.
You can remove this folder if you don't need the provided samples.

In order to make these samples to work properly, you should go to "Menu->SmartColliders2D->Samples->Setup Project".
This will modify the collisions layers and the collision masks for those layers to fit the samples requirements.

Special Thanks to Kenney for the CC0 Graphic Assets: www.kenney.nl, used for the samples.
